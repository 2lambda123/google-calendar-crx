# Google Calendar for Chrome

## Soon To Be Unpublished

This Chrome extension is no longer available, and will soon be unpublished from the Chrome Extensions Store.

For more than a decade, this has been a side project for me, and I have enjoyed working on it for most of that time. But during the last couple of years, the sheer number of requests I have received from various teams at Google to make changes (small and large) to this extension far outweigh the amount of time I am able to spend on it.

This was originally a hackathon project encouraged by the Chrome and Calendar teams before the public launch of the Chrome Extensions API. Since then, I have tried unsuccessfully to transition formal ownership to the Calendar team, but they are not interested in adopting it as part of their first-party roadmap, which I fully understand.

It’s best for our 4 MM+ users, for Google, and for myself to declare this project formally shut down.

Thanks to all the users and contributors for your hard work, especially our volunteer translators, and everyone who has contributed bug fixes and performance improvements over the years.

## Alternatives

### Source Code

This Git repo will remain available, in case anyone is interested in forking it and releasing it as their own extension under their own account. The [Apache 2 License](COPYING) explicitly permits it, and I encourage you to do that.

### Other Extensions

There are several other extensions available that include similar features. Feel free to send pull requests editing this README to list your extension here.
